    A replacement for the "open" function that can also read and write
    compressed files transparently. The supported compression formats are gzip,
    bzip2 and xz. If the filename is '-', standard output (mode 'w') or
    standard input (mode 'r') is returned.

    When writing, the file format is chosen based on the file name extension:
    - .gz uses gzip compression
    - .bz2 uses bzip2 compression
    - .xz uses xz/lzma compression
    - otherwise, no compression is used

    When reading, if a file name extension is available, the format is detected
    using it, but if not, the format is detected from the contents.

    mode can be: 'rt', 'rb', 'at', 'ab', 'wt', or 'wb'. Also, the 't' can be omitted,
    so instead of 'rt', 'wt' and 'at', the abbreviations 'r', 'w' and 'a' can be used.

    compresslevel is the compression level for writing to gzip files.
    This parameter is ignored for the other compression formats. If set to
    None (default), level 6 is used.

    threads only has a meaning when reading or writing gzip files.

    When threads is None (the default), reading or writing a gzip file is done with a pigz
    (parallel gzip) subprocess if possible. See PipedGzipWriter and PipedGzipReader.

    When threads = 0, no subprocess is used.
