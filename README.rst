=====
xopen
=====

This Python module provides an ``xopen`` function that works like the
built-in ``open`` function but also transparently deals with compressed files.
Supported compression formats are currently gzip, bzip2, xz and zstandard.

``xopen`` selects the most efficient method for reading or writing a compressed file.
This often means opening a pipe to an external tool, such as
`pigz <https://zlib.net/pigz/>`_, which is a parallel version of ``gzip``,
or `igzip <https://github.com/intel/isa-l/>`_, which is a highly optimized
version of ``gzip``.

If ``threads=0`` is passed to ``xopen()``, no external process is used.
For gzip files, this will then use `python-isal
<https://github.com/pycompression/python-isal>`_ (which binds isa-l) if
it is installed (since ``python-isal`` is a dependency of ``xopen``,
this should always be the case).
Neither ``igzip`` nor ``python-isal`` support compression levels
greater 3, so if no external tool is available or ``threads`` has been set to 0,
Python’s built-in ``gzip.open`` is used.

For xz files, a pipe to the ``xz`` program is used because it has built-in support for multithreaded compression.

For bz2 files, `pbzip2 (parallel bzip2) <http://compression.ca/pbzip2/>`_ is used.

``xopen`` falls back to Python’s built-in functions
(``gzip.open``, ``lzma.open``, ``bz2.open``)
if none of the other methods can be used.

The file format to use is determined from the file name if the extension is recognized
(``.gz``, ``.bz2``, ``.xz`` or ``.zst``).
When reading a file without a recognized file extension, xopen attempts to detect the format
by reading the first couple of bytes from the file.

``xopen`` is compatible with Python versions 3.7 and later.


Usage
-----

Open a file for reading::

    from xopen import xopen

    with xopen("file.txt.gz") as f:
        content = f.read()

Write to a file in binary mode,
set the compression level
and avoid using an external process::

    from xopen import xopen

    with xopen("file.txt.xz", mode="wb", threads=0, compresslevel=3)
        f.write(b"Hello")


Changes
-------

v1.5.0 (2022-03-23)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* #100: Dropped Python 3.6 support
* #101: Added support for piping into and from an external ``xz`` process. Contributed by @fanninpm.
* #102: Support setting the xz compression level. Contributed by @tsibley.

v1.4.0 (2022-01-14)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add ``seek()`` and ``tell()`` to the ``PipedCompressionReader`` classes
  (for Windows compatibility)

v1.3.0 (2022-01-10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* xopen is now available on Windows (in addition to Linux and macOS).
* For greater compatibility with `the built-in open()
  function <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open>`_,
  ``xopen()`` has gained the parameters *encoding*, *errors* and *newlines*
  with the same meaning as in ``open()``. Unlike built-in ``open()``, though,
  encoding is UTF-8 by default.
* A parameter *format* has been added that allows to force the compression
  file format.

v1.2.0 (2021-09-21)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `pbzip2 <http://compression.ca/pbzip2/>`_ is now used to open ``.bz2`` files if
  ``threads`` is greater than zero (contributed by @DriesSchaumont).

v1.1.0 (2021-01-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Python 3.5 support is dropped.
* On Linux systems, `python-isal <https://github.com/pycompression/python-isal>`_
  is now added as a requirement. This will speed up the reading of gzip files
  significantly when no external processes are used.

v1.0.0 (2020-11-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* If installed, the ``igzip`` program (part of
  `Intel ISA-L <https://github.com/intel/isa-l/>`_) is now used for reading
  and writing gzip-compressed files at compression levels 1-3, which results
  in a significant speedup.

v0.9.0 (2020-04-02)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* #80: When the file name extension of a file to be opened for reading is not
  available, the content is inspected (if possible) and used to determine
  which compression format applies (contributed by @bvaisvil).
* This release drops Python 2.7 and 3.4 support. Python 3.5 or later is
  now required.

v0.8.4 (2019-10-24)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* When reading gzipped files, force ``pigz`` to use only a single process.
  ``pigz`` cannot use multiple cores anyway when decompressing. By default,
  it would use extra I/O processes, which slightly reduces wall-clock time,
  but increases CPU time. Single-core decompression with ``pigz`` is still
  about twice as fast as regular ``gzip``.
* Allow ``threads=0`` for specifying that no external ``pigz``/``gzip``
  process should be used (then regular ``gzip.open()`` is used instead).

v0.8.3 (2019-10-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* #20: When reading gzipped files, let ``pigz`` use at most four threads by default.
  This limit previously only applied when writing to a file. Contributed by @bernt-matthias.
* Support Python 3.8

v0.8.0 (2019-08-14)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* #14: Speed improvements when iterating over gzipped files.

v0.6.0 (2019-05-23)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* For reading from gzipped files, xopen will now use a ``pigz`` subprocess.
  This is faster than using ``gzip.open``.
* Python 2 support will be dropped in one of the next releases.

v0.5.0 (2019-01-30)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* By default, pigz is now only allowed to use at most four threads. This hopefully reduces
  problems some users had with too many threads when opening many files at the same time.
* xopen now accepts pathlib.Path objects.

v0.4.0 (2019-01-07)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Drop Python 3.3 support
* Add a ``threads`` parameter (passed on to ``pigz``)

v0.3.2 (2017-11-22)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* #6: Make multi-block bz2 work on Python 2 by using external bz2file library.

v0.3.1 (2017-11-22)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Drop Python 2.6 support
* #5: Fix PipedGzipReader.read() not returning anything

v0.3.0 (2017-11-15)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add gzip compression parameter

v0.2.1 (2017-05-31)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* #3: Allow appending to bz2 and lzma files where possible

v0.1.1 (2016-12-02)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix a deadlock

v0.1.0 (2016-09-09)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Initial release

Credits
-------

The name ``xopen`` was taken from the C function of the same name in the
`utils.h file which is part of
BWA <https://github.com/lh3/bwa/blob/83662032a2192d5712996f36069ab02db82acf67/utils.h>`_.

Some ideas were taken from the `canopener project <https://github.com/selassid/canopener>`_.
If you also want to open S3 files, you may want to use that module instead.

@kyleabeauchamp contributed support for appending to files before this repository was created.
